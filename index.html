      <p>I was raised in the mountains and through rigorous training, I became the strongest man on this planet.<strong>I am sorry Saitama and his fans.</strong>(<em>Anime reference</em>)I was born on the planet Uzito and was given the name Mzito at birth. As a baby, my parents sent me to the mountains in a nduthi moments before Uzito was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. My nduthi landed in the Uzito mountainside. I was found and adopted by a troop of gorillas.I developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin.</p>

      <p>I am just messing around..lol..</p>
      <p>So, you are here to see my awesome...or crappy page(Be nice) for my programming portfolio.So,lemme start by giving you a little introduction about myself.</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>As I mentioned before,my name is George Wayne Mwangi and I am superhero.<em>Just incase you missed the first part..hehe</em>I am a full time student persuing a Bachelor's degree in Marine Engineering.And I know what you are thinking...but no,I don't talk to fishðŸ˜‚.I leave that to my buddy Aquaman.</p>
      <p>Generally, my area of study deals with the running of machinery on board a sea vessel and other offshore structures,especially the engine and auxialliay machine.So,the next time you import your car,remember to say a prayer for hardworking,oil-covered bastards in the metal containers working tirelessly to get your car to you in no time.</p>

      <p>Now,onto the juicy parts:</p>

      <p>I decided to pursue Software Engineering at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"> Moringa School</a> because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>They are amazing.</li>
        <li>They are the G.O.A.T</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In short,it is the best place to start a new direction in life due to the promise of a great future. The way they nurture the noobs like me and mould us into a force to reckon is simply without equal. Due to this, I am able to turn my interest in programming into a reality through the mentorship of great minds that form such a unique family.</p>

      <div class="projects">
      <p>Thank you for still being on my page upto this point.Now let us get into the technical details.</p>
      <p>I have been able to get started on this journey by trying out a couple of simple projects through the help of my technical mentor and peers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/hello-world">Hello world(Written in HTML and CSS and is my introduction to the programming world)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/corrected-cookie-recipe">Cookie recipe(Written in HTML and CSS. This is a corrected cookie recipe that i worked on after cloning a repository from Github)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/resort-website">Resort Website(Written in HTML and CSS. This is an exercise to practice styling using CSS)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/happytrails">Happy Trails Travel Agency website(Written in HTML and CSS. It is an exercise to practice using classes and IDs)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/GeorgeWayneMwangi/my-first-webpage">My first webpage</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>I know, i know..it is not fancy but remember,a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I will steadily improve through practice and will eventually be the best.I am a superhero after all..hehe..</p>
